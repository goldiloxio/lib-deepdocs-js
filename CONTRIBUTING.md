# Contributing

If you're reading this, you're on your way adding code to a feep repository! Prior to setting up a
pull request, be sure to discuss any questions and concerns with the feep practice(on Slack `eng-frontend`).
Next, do a scan of the steps below, then get to coding. Best of luck!

## Pull Request Process

1. Follow README.md instructions accordingly.
2. Fill out Pull Request template as provided.
3. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, useful file locations and container parameters.
4. Increase the version numbers in the package.json and the CHANGELOG.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
5. Obtain two code reviews and QA approval from developers.
6. Merge PR (yay!).
